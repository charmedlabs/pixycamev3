# Samples for pixycamev3

Here you find some examples in two folders: Python3 and MicroPython.
Choose Python3 when you are running ev3dev on the EV3-Brick or MicroPython
if you are running PyBricks on the EV3-Brick. Both folders contain the
same kind of examples.

These examples can be used to learn how to use Pixy2 with pixycamev3. We have
tried to keep the examples as simple as possible. There are many ways to
improve the progams in functionality and programming style (to make them more
'pythonic').

Description of the sample code:
1. barcode_scanner: scan barcode (one at a time) and say it's number.
2. display_blocks: detect blocks for sig1 and display the largest block on
the EV3-display.
3. line_tracking: line following program.
4. object_chasing: detect and follow an object.

For each sample program there is a Python3 version (cp prefix) and a
MicroPython version (mp prefix).

## How to use the example code

Copy an example py-file to your projectfolder. Install pixycamev3 as described
in the [tutorial](https://docs.pixycam.com/wiki/doku.php?id=wiki:v2:python).
Now you are ready to run the program on your EV3-Brick.
